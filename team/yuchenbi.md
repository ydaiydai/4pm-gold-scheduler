Hi, my name is Yuchen Bi. I am a transfer student from bay erea.
//ideal: In my opinion, Gold Scheduler is a tool to make class register easy. First, Gold Scheduler show all the classes offered in the coming quater. After students decide which classes they are going to take, they can simply click on those classes. In stead of comparing in mind, making note of the each classes' schedule to prevent time confilct, Gold Scheduler will display all the potential schedule combination of those classes on several weekly schedule tables. If there is no schedule combination of those classes that can cause no confilct, the Gold Scheduler will indicate it and tell the user to give up on one of it.
