My name is Victor Sanchez Gutierrez!

I'm a junior transfer from the Bay Area and like to play Smash

My idea for GOLD-Scheduler is that it should provide a clear and easy to use way for UCSB students to plan their future quarter schedules
by using multiple psuedo-schedules to visualize their classes. From there the student can pick the best schedule for the quarter and 
quickly register for those classes.
