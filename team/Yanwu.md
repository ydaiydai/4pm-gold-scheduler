Hello, My name is Yanwu Tong and I am majored in computer science. I am a second year student in UCSB

some ideas:

the basice work of gold-scheduler can do is to allow users create time table for classes that they select for the next quarter. 

users will have access to know all information of the classes that will open in the next quarter may includes time of lectures.
time conflict should be point out and allow user to choose which they want to take. 

Here is one way that can show the time of courses more clearly. When there is onlu one course in the searching area, the time of lecture and sections will show on the time table with semitransparent color. Once the users confirm which section and lecture they will take, the color of time that they select will turn into opaque and other section time will disappear.
Also, if users want to make some change for the class they already select, they can click the class on the time table and all information of this class will show in the searching area.
