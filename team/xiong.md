My name is Xiong Jin (Kingsley)

I'm a junior transfer student from the LA.

The basic idea of gold-scheduler(GS) is that the GS website can generate weekly-schedules which are similar to the ones on UCSB GOLD. Different sections from different classes are combined together. Users can easily find out the time over-lapping problem between different classes.
