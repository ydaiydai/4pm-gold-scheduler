Hi~here's Yuan.
I think our project can include multiple class schedule searching, management.
We can seperate the web page as two part. Left side for the table of schedule, and the right side can be the searching system.
As same as gold, in the right side, students can search their courses by subject and class number, and the system will show them all the sections and discussion.
Then, then can choose them. If the time conflict happended, the note will show up.
